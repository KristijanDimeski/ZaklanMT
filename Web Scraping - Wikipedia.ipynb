      "<p><i><b>Bad Boys II</b></i> is a 2003 American buddy cop action comedy film directed by Michael Bay, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and sequel to the 1995 film <i>Bad Boys</i>, in addition to the second film in the <i>Bad Boys</i> film series. Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, Theresa Randle and Joe Pantoliano reprise their roles from the previous film. New cast members include Jordi Mollà, Gabrielle Union and Peter Stormare. The film follows detectives Burnett and Lowrey investigating the flow of illegal drugs going into Miami.\n",
      "</p><p><i>Bad Boys II</i> was released on July 18, 2003. It received generally negative reviews from critics, with the Rotten Tomatoes critics' consensus describing it as \"two and a half hours of explosions and witless banter\"; however, it performed fairly well commercially, grossing $273 million worldwide. A third film, <i>Bad Boys for Life</i>, was released in January 2020.\n",

      "<p>Eight years after taking down Fouchet, Miami PD detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett are investigating drug trafficking of ecstasy in Miami. They infiltrate a Klan meeting, only to discover that they are buyers and not distributors. After a radio malfunction leads to a delayed arrival of Miami Police's Tactical Narcotics Team (TNT), Mike and Marcus end up in a shootout with the Klansmen, with Marcus accidentally sustaining a gunshot wound to the buttocks from Mike.\n",
      "</p><p>These antics lead Marcus to re-evaluate whether he should remain partners with Mike, who is secretly dating Syd, Marcus' younger sister. Unbeknownst to both Marcus and Mike, Syd is working undercover for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) as a money launderer to a branch of the Russian Mafia operating in Miami's drug trade who are distributors working with the drug lord Hector Juan Carlos \"Johnny\" Tapia. After laundering a large sum of money, Syd is intercepted by a Haitian Zoe Pound gang while she is transporting the money. Mike and Marcus, working on a tip from an informant, had been following the Haitians when the latter made their move, leading to an extensive gun battle and car chase through Miami that resulted in significant collateral damage. Mike and Marcus were reprimanded by Captain Howard, who was further miffed to find out the DEA was running an investigation in Miami without consulting him first.\n",
      "</p><p>Mike and Marcus track down the Haitians, interrogate the leader, and learn from one of the Haitian's video cameras that Tapia is using a local mortuary as a front for his operations. To gain more intel, Mike and Marcus pose as pest exterminators responding to a rat infestation at Tapia's Miami residence. Meanwhile, Tapia is meeting with his Russian business associates. Tapia has one of his associates butchered as a threat to sign over all the nightclubs to distribute ecstasy. Tapia begins a mixed business-personal relationship with Syd wherein he intends for her to launder all of the money for his operation.\n",
      "</p><p>Later, Mike and Marcus infiltrate Tapia's mortuary. Inside they discover that Tapia is using cadavers and coffins to smuggle drugs and money in and out of the country. The evidence is sufficient for Captain Howard to authorize a raid on both Tapia's residence and the mortuary in collaboration with the DEA and the U.S. Coast Guard. Nearly all of Tapia's drug supply and money are confiscated in the raid, though Tapia flees to Cuba with Syd as a hostage before he can be apprehended. Using her as a bargaining chip, Tapia demands the return of his money. Knowing that is impossible, Mike and Marcus arrange a covert operation to rescue Syd, forming a black-ops team with agents from the DEA, TNT, and Captain Howard's contacts from the CIA.\n",
      "</p><p>The team is inserted by the Coast Guard a few miles off the coast of Cuba, where they rendezvous with a fellow officer's brother, Tito, who is head of the local Alpha 66 underground resistance in Cuba. There, Tito assists the teams with weapons, a tunnel network, and an accurate mapping of Tapia's new mansion.\n",
      "</p><p>The team infiltrates Tapia's mansion, rescues Syd, and leaves a large explosive device that demolishes the mansion upon the team's exfiltration. Marcus and Mike, along with Syd and Tito, steal a yellow Hummer H2 as they escape from Cuban military forces. Tapia survives and pursues the group, ultimately ending up outside of Guantanamo Bay. Not recognized as U.S. Citizens, the Navy personnel on the base shoot at both Mike and Marcus as well as Tapia's vehicles, prompting them to stop just as they enter a live minefield. Marcus kills Tapia while the latter holds Mike at gunpoint. Tapia's body falls backward onto a mine which obliterates his corpse. \n",
      "</p><p>Mike, Marcus, and Syd celebrate at a barbecue in Marcus' backyard with his family; Marcus has decided to remain partners with Mike.\n",

Hancock was tasked with making the script less simplistic, in addition to adding subplots, and more conflict, giving each protagonist a secret.

By June 2015, director Joe Carnahan was in early talks to write and possibly direct the film. Two months later, Sony Pictures Entertainment announced that <i>Bad Boys III</i> would be released on February 17, 2017, and that additional sequel, <i>Bad Boys IV</i>, is scheduled for release on July 3, 2019.

On August 11, 2016, the film was pushed back once again to January 12, 2018, to avoid box office competition with the upcoming DC Comics film <i>Wonder Woman</i>, and retitled <i>Bad Boys for Life</i>. Lawrence revealed on <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i> that filming may start in March 2017. On February 6, 2017, it was announced that the film's release date has been delayed for the third time, to November 9, 2018. On March 7, 2017, Carnahan left the movie due to scheduling conflicts.
